# To do
* [x] Debate whether to install atuin: https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin#nushell
* [x] See this nushell config: https://github.com/nullishamy/derivation-station/blob/master/users/amy/apps/tools/nu/config.nu#L1
* [x] Make nushell command to update system: sys_update = paru -Syu --noconfirm & rustup update
* [x] use Eww instead of waybar?
* [x] Change starship config location to ~/.config/starship/config.toml (export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/.config/starship/config.toml)
* [x] xwaylandvideobridge should autostart on login
* [x] Set a wallpaper
* [x] brightnessctl ?
* [x] chezmoi + command to commit changes
* [x] fix lockscreen commands and stuff
* [x] fix dark theme system-wide and thumbnails; fix dolphin - Papirus icons?; set QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
* [x] go to lockscreen on lid close and go to sleep (see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#ACPI_events)
* [x] fix poweroff, reboot, suspend, hibernate - for long press power button maybe turn off, otherwise sleep?
* [x] set brightness and volume keys
* [x] show bluetooth, wifi, battery info in bar
* [x] set screenshot key to something like: grim -g "$(slurp)" - | swappy -f - (we're using grimblast though)
* [ ] helix: select next matching word with key (Ctrl + D?) and move lines up and down with keys (Alt + Up/Down or j/k?)
* [ ] ripgrep-all with fzf? https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all/wiki/fzf-Integration
* [x] [numbat](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat) widget instead of calculator app? Somewhat hacky, but it works
* [ ] see this: https://github.com/quantonganh/helix-wezterm
* [ ] https://github.com/coffebar/hyprland-monitor-attached
* [ ] fix cursor theme
* [ ] Find a display configurator (e.g., wdisplays), but make sure it works well on Hyprland
* [ ] Remove dependency on wlogout, waybar and rofi by using something similar to eww (but eww seems unmaintained?)

# Left to config
* [x] bat: https://github.com/catppuccin/bat
* [x] fzf
* [x] rofi
* [ ] delta -- to do catppuccin theme manually
* [x] bottom
* [x] greetd
* [?] helix -- left to integrate with broot and gitui
* [x] gitui
* [?] broot -- left to integrate with helix
* [x] mako
* [x] atuin
* [?] hypr -- left integration with other apps: mako, swaylock, swayidle, brightnessctl, wl-clipboard?, grim, slurp
* [x] nushell
* [x] swaylock
* [ ] eww
* [x] wezterm
* [x] zellij
* [x] starship
